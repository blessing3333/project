                      <p class="person">Any person or business is legally eligible to submit a Canadian immigration application on their own. But, it’s OK to want a little guidance.</p>
                      <p class="first">IRCC instructions are extremely detailed and not always easy to understand the first or fifth time you have read them.</p>
                      <p class="first">You may not have the time or desire to learn Canadian immigration laws and regulations, and how they apply to your individual situation. Even if your application is straightforward, there are so many details that can cause it to be returned or refused – a simple mistake can cause you to lose months that your application could have been in process.</p>
                      <p class="first">This is where we come in.</p>
                      <p class="first">DFI offers several options to guide you through a complicated and sometimes confusing immigration system.</p>
